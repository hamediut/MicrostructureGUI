; Inno Setup script for SMiCA (Statistical Microstructure Characterisation & Analysis).
; Packages the PyInstaller onedir build in dist\SMiCA\ into a single Setup.exe:
; Start Menu entry, optional desktop shortcut, uninstaller, and the Microsoft
; VC++ Redistributable as a prerequisite (see [Run] below - the frozen build's
; main.py deliberately does NOT bundle its own copy of those runtime DLLs,
; since doing so crashes Qt6Core.dll on startup; the installer is what
; guarantees the target machine has a working copy instead).

DisableDirPage=no
; Bundling the VC++ redistributable installer requires it to run elevated,
; so this installer always requests admin rights (the Inno Setup default).
